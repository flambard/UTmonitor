UTmonitor
=========

A simple Erlang program for monitoring Unreal Tournament (and possibly other) games.

Views player stats in a window. Use with a projector for greatest effect!

Compile the program like this:

    $ erl -make

And run it like this:

    erlang> utmonitor:start("serverhostname").
